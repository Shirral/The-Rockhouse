# The Rockhouse

![mockup](the-rockhouse/media/readme/mockup.jpg "A mockup picture for The Rockhouse project.")

["The Rockhouse"](https://github.com/Shirral/The-Rockhouse) is a fictional virtual pet rock adoption centre. The idea is simple: adopt a rock of your choice - they all have their unique qualities: material, texture, even personality - and enjoy the status of a proud rock owner, all without the hassle of shipping and having to have physical space for your new pet rock, while supporting a group of rock enthusiasts who care for it at their facility in your name! It's just like adopting an animal at the zoo. Except it's about rocks. And while you won't have your rock with you in person, it will sit proudly in your online profile for all to see. There, you can use the customisation tool to dress it up with silly accessories, add a frame, and show it off to the world!

## User Experience & User Interface (UX/UI)

### Site goals

The goal of the site is to offer the user a unique way of showcasing their passion for rocks while supporting the world of geology and the people enthusiastic about by giving them an option to virtually adopt one (or many) of the rocks available at the website. It aims to make the experience fun and rewarding by making each and every rock unique, using humour in the way the rocks are presented as if they were living pets, and giving the user a way to customise their rock by accessorising it after it's been adopted.

### Design

**Colour scheme**

The colour scheme of The Rockhouse is very minimalistic. It uses Bootstrap's main colours - white, dark grey (#212529), and light grey (#6c757d) - and Bootstrap's default colours for the alert messages: red for errors/danger, yellow for warnings, blue for information, and green for success.

**Typography**

Focused on functionality rather than design, The Rockhouse uses Bootstrap's default native font stack settings, which use the user's current system font. This ensures the design will always remain clean, functional and easy to read, while not requiring the user to load any additional external font resources. Basic sans-serif web fonts are provided as fallbacks.

**Imagery**

As the website is all about the rocks, the spotlight is on them. The images of the rocks available for adoption are vibrant and enticing - the rocks are supposed to draw attention with their colours, shapes and textures. They are presented on soft, neutral backgrounds.

The images of accessories currently available in the customisation app are examples sourced from stock picture websites; ideally, the website administrators would create all of the accessories and frames themselves, keeping them stylistically cohesive and making sure they fit the shapes of every rock available in The Rockhouse well, and add new accessories to the app regularly.

**Wireframes**

The wireframes made in the planning stage of the project work have guided me later on. I followed them rather closely, intending to keep the project's design minimalistic right from the start. I have decided not to include several elements that have been included in the wireframes and to add others which haven't been planned there, though. The wireframes have been prepared with Wireframe.cc.
